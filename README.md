Learning how to collaborate

# AdvancedR3:

This project is created in order to learn how to more effectively
collaborate in R

# Brief description of folder and file contents

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`: raw data
-   `docs/`: quarto and rmarkdown files
-   `R/`: functions

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the `AdvancedR3.Rproj`
file and running this command in the console:

```         
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak()
```

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.

documentation.
